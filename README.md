Foodies
For my fifth and final project with Code Institute I chose to create a baking community based content sharing platform to share baking creations to a global audience. Foodies is all about yummy food, sweet treats and all things good. The platform enables users to create posts, edit or delete posts,read posts,comment and like on posts. Users can also follow other users and keep up to date on their latest creations. Users can use the search bar at the top to browse through the platform's posts. Search results can be filtered on usernames, popularity, date created, title, content keywords and category. This is my advanced front-end project, I hope you enjoy it! - [LIVE LINK]
